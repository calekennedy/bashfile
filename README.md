# Create a symlink

Open terminal to the location you wish to save your .bash_profile

Using the following command in terminal

  ln -s path/to/the/git/repo/.bash_profile .bash_profile

On my machine it is (relatively) located at Projects/personal/bashfile. So...

  ln -s Projects/personal/bashfile/.bash_profile .bash_profile

You will now have a symlink to the version controlled .bash_profile
